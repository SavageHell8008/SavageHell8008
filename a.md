## ⚡ **Project Overview**
Welcome to the **Facial Reconstruction Model** powered by **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. The project aims to reconstruct high-quality facial images by overcoming challenges such as **motion blur**, **occlusions**, and **lighting variations**. Step into the future of **AI-enhanced image restoration**!

<summary>🚀 <b>Model Architecture (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

### 🧠 **Core Machine Learning Techniques**
- **Generator**: U-Net-like architecture with advanced **skip connections** for smoother gradient flow.
- **Discriminator**: Leverages **Batch Normalization**, **Instance Normalization**, and **Gradient Penalty** for more stable and efficient training.

### 🔧 **Image Enhancement Techniques**
- **Deblurring**: Integrated **DeBlurGAN-v2** to reduce motion blur in real-time scenarios.
- **Upscaling**: High-resolution facial detail enhancement via **ESRGAN** (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN).

### ⚙️ **Real-Time Processing & Optimization**
Despite hardware constraints:
- **Batch size**: 16
- **Training time**: ~4 hours per epoch on a **16GB RAM, Ryzen 5 CPU** setup.

### 🔄 **Motion Blur**
We counter motion blur using **DeBlurGAN** and plan to upgrade to **DeBlurGAN-v2** for better fast-motion handling.

### 🦾 **Occlusions**
Skip connections in the generator help recover finer details from non-occluded regions.

### 🌟 **Lighting Variations**
Training across multiple lighting conditions using **Instance Normalization** ensures robustness and adaptability.

<summary>🔮 <b>Future Enhancements (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

- **Facial Recognition and 3D Reconstruction**: Future versions will include facial recognition and 3D facial reconstruction techniques for better accuracy.
- **Performance Optimization**: Training for 100 epochs will enhance the facial detail reconstruction and reduce artifacts.

#### 🚧 **Hardware Constraints**
Current training is limited by hardware (16GB RAM, Ryzen 5 CPU), resulting in slower training (4 hours per epoch). More epochs will be required to achieve optimal results.
