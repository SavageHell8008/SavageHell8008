## 📋 Project Overview
This project implements a **Facial Reconstruction Model** using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to enhance low-quality facial images. The model tackles challenges like **motion blur**, **occlusions**, and **lighting variations** to provide high-quality reconstructions.

<summary>🔍 <b>Model Architecture</b> </summary>

### Machine Learning Techniques
- **Generator**: U-Net-like architecture with skip connections for better gradient flow during training.
- **Discriminator**: Batch and instance normalization with gradient penalty for stable training.

### Image Enhancement Techniques
- **Deblurring**: Integrating **DeBlurGAN-v2** for real-time motion blur reduction.
- **Upscaling**: Using **ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN)** to refine facial details for high-resolution output.

### Real-Time Processing
Despite hardware limitations, the model has been optimized for efficiency:
- 🖥️ **Hardware**: 16GB RAM, Ryzen 5 CPU.
- ⏳ **Training**: Takes approximately **4 hours per epoch** for a batch size of 16.

<summary>⚙️ <b>Challenges and Approach</b></summary>

### Motion Blur
We tackle motion blur by leveraging **DeBlurGAN** and **DeBlurGAN-v2** for handling fast motion in video frames.

### Occlusions
Using **skip connections** in the generator to recover finer details from non-occluded regions.

### Lighting Variations
GANs are trained across various lighting setups using **instance normalization** to ensure robustness across diverse conditions.

<summary>📈 <b>Future Enhancements Plan</b> </summary>

- **Facial Recognition** and **3D Reconstruction**: In future iterations, we aim to integrate 3D reconstruction techniques for more versatile outputs.
- **Performance Optimization**: Training will continue through 100 epochs to improve results, particularly in facial detail reconstruction.
  
#### 🚧 Hardware Constraints:
Due to **16GB RAM** and a **Ryzen 5 CPU**, training time is around **4 hours per epoch**. However, we anticipate significant improvements with more epochs.
